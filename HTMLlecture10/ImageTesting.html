		<h2>Albert Einstein's Quotation</h2>

		<p><h2> Explanation: </h2>When some people run into difficulty when venturing into new territory, they simply give up.<br><br>

		This new territory could be anything they have set out to do, and when they run into a roadblock they may try various solutions to work around the issues. But in time, they run out of ideas, or time, or patience and throw in the towel. (ie., “forgetaboutit”)<br><br>

		If something is easy to do/accomplish, then others would have already done what you attempting to accomplish.<br><br>

		And therein lies what Einstein referred to as an “opportunity”. The chance to solve a problem that others have attempted to address and abandoned. I personally like to call technical opportunities a “challenge”.<br><br>

		When you tell a scientist/engineer/hacker/whatever - there is no way to do xyz, you are basically waving a red cape in front of a bull. An opportunity to solve a problem/situation that seems insurmountable is very difficult to ignore.<br><br></p>
